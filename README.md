# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a simple task of understanding the emotions of the writer of a particular text. What was the intent of the writer when writing a certain thing?

We use various natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis tools to figure out what could be subjective information. We need to identify, extract and quantify such details from the text for easier classification and working with the data.

But why do we need sentiment analysis?

Sentiment analysis serves as a fundamental aspect of dealing with customers on online portals and websites for the companies. They do this all the time to classify a comment as a query, complaint, suggestion, opinion, or just love for a product. This way they can easily sort through the comments or questions and prioritize what they need to handle first and even order them in a way that looks better. Companies sometimes even try to delete content that has a negative sentiment attached to it.

The dataset which we will use in sentiment analysis is the International Movie Database(IMDb) reviews for 50,000 reviews of movies from all over the world, its a binary classification dataset categorizing each review in a positive or negative. It has 25000 samples for training and 25000 for testing.

You donâ€™t need to download it separately for this project but you can have a look at it on its official website. Because it is a text dataset it is very lightweight around 80MB.

We are going to code all this up in a jupyter notebook on google colab to make use of the free gpu. If you follow along on your own system everything will be pretty much the same except for mounting the google drive for use as a persistent storage option.
